# Vuex ORM

[[toc]]

## Introduction To The API

You might be surprised by how much value vuex-orm gives us out of the box!

Here's a quick runthrough the vuex-orm API.

## Getting Started

Let's setup a new vue project, and get up and running with vuex-orm

## Relationships: One To One

Now that we know how to register vuex-orm classes, let's go ahead and define our first relationship, "**one to one**"!

## Relationships: One To Many

In this video, we'll create two **one to many** relationships.

- A **User** has many **Lists**
- A **List** has many **Items**

## Relationships: Has Many By

The **Has Many By** is kinda like the **One To Many** relationship.

The difference is that the parent model holds *an array of ids*. These *ids* are used to identify the models children.

## Building The Todo App

We've come this far, and still haven't built the **todo app** :scream:...

So that's what we'll do in this video :blush:

## Relationships: Has Many Through

Sometimes you may need to find distant data.

Imagine having a user, that has many lists, and items within those lists. Now, you just want to grab all of the users items, perhaps to make a kind of *super list*.

That's why we have this **special** relationship.

It is the joiner of souls. The link between the earth and the stars. The bridger of gaps.

It is the **Has Many Through** relationship :heart:

## Relationships: Many To Many (explanation)

Time to spice things up a little bit! For the **Many To Many** relationship, we're gonna need what's called a **pivot table**.

Pivot tables have one purpose in life... To **form a relationship between two models!**

This is probably the second most complicated relationship we'll be exploring in this series, so **take the time to make sure it all makes sense**.

## Relationships: Many To Many

What's that? You think you're ready to implement a **Many To Many** relationship in code using vuex-orm?

Hmmm, I don't know... It's pretty hard...

Are you sure you wouldn't rather just take a break? This whole coding thing is far too overwhelming right?...

Right?

**WRONG!!!**

That was a test! Did you pass?

*Good*

Now let's get to work. Watch the video below, level up and keep at it!

## Relationships: One To One Polymorphic (explanation)

Things can start to feel a little complicated when **polymorphism** is introduced into the mix.

But like most things, when you take it **one step at a time**, it's really quite simple at its core!

So let's explore the **one to one polymorphic relationship** and remember...

*Use that pause button!*

## Relationships: One To One Polymorphic

I have good news...

You're ready to explore **one to one polymorphic relationships** in vuex-orm!!!

(this is the part where you cheer with excitement) :tada:

So grab a coffee, crack your fingers and let's **dive. right. in!**
